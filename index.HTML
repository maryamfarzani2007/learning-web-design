    <P>Hollo , thank you for reading this. <br><br> I'm 18 years old and right know I started to learn programming or coding <br> our couch said thet I should write some sentences about myself so here we are <br> as you can assume from my age I just graduated from high school <br> and I am cosidering studying medicine in Italy <br> But first I always wanted to learn a skill that gives me freedom of choose and location <br> so I chosed programming because as far as I know it makes my brain think and problem solve which I love myself more when my brain solves complex problems <br> and this skill will give me reyable income duing short-time freelance projects during my student years and years behind that <br> and also extremely useful in healthcare. <br>I am excited to learn. </P>
